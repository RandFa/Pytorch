# Pytorch

Welcome to the PyTorch Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects focusing on various applications of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

## Project 1: Pneumonia Detection from X-ray Images
### Overview
The first project in this repository focuses on detecting pneumonia from X-ray images using PyTorch. Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that can be diagnosed through the analysis of X-ray images. This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying X-ray images as either showing signs of pneumonia or being normal.

### Description
Pneumonia detection from X-ray images is crucial for timely and accurate diagnosis, especially in healthcare settings where prompt treatment is essential. Leveraging PyTorch, this project aims to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze X-ray images and classify them based on the presence or absence of pneumonia. By automating this process, healthcare professionals can expedite diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

### Goals
Utilize PyTorch for building and training deep learning models.
Develop a CNN-based classifier for pneumonia detection from X-ray images.
Improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pneumonia detection.

### Contents
Data: Contains datasets of X-ray images labeled as pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.
